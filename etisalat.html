				<h1><u>Welcome to UAE Telecom</u></h1>
				<h2>Telecommunications in the United Arab Emirates</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Telecommunications in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is under the control 
				and supervision of the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory 
				Authority which was established under UAE Federal Law by Decree No. 3 of 2003.
				 From 1976 to 2006 the Emirates Telecommunications Corporation (Etisalat) was the 
				sole telephone and telecommunications provider for the UAE.
				 And while there were exceptions for free zones and modern housing developments, 
				for the majority of the UAE, Etisalat held a monopoly on business and personal 
				telecommunications services. In February 2006, this monopoly became a duopoly when a 
				new telephone company and Internet service provider (ISP), du, was established to offer 
				mobile services across the UAE and Internet and TV services to some free zone areas. 
				However, due to geographical distribution of service areas, the companies do not compete 
				for customers and thus effectively operate as monopolies.[2] Earlier du provided triple play 
				services to free zone areas under the name Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC), 
				which is still its legal name.
